# Agent Boot File — FR5 Simulator (Current State)

## Step 0: Who You Are

You're helping build an offline FK/IK simulator for a Fairino FR5 6-axis
arm, rendered in Polyscope. No real robot or hardware connection — this is
pure math + visualisation.

## Step 1: 30-Second Project Overview

### What the System Does

Takes 6 joint angles (or a target end-effector pose) and renders the
corresponding FR5 arm configuration in an interactive 3D window.

### Current Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Polyscope app skeleton | done | `main.py` wires `VisContent`/`UI_Menu` into Polyscope's per-frame callback |
| FK maths (`compute_fk`) | done | See `docs/FR5_DH_Table.md` |
| Mesh loading + rendering | done | Delta-transform pipeline — see `docs/FR5_Mesh_Convention.md` |
| Joint sliders | done | "Forward Kinematics" panel, `gui_panel.py` |
| Tool head + TCP tracking | done | See `wiki/003_Guides/TCP_Frame.md` |
| Analytical IK | done | Closed-form solver, multi-solution — see `settled.md` S1.4/S1.5 |
| TCP trajectory recording | done | See `wiki/003_Guides/TCP_Trajectory.md` |
| G-code print preview | done | G0/G1-only parser, fixed `model.gcode` path; rendered as a swept **bead surface mesh** (width from extrusion `E`, height from layer height), reloads on plate reposition — see `wiki/003_Guides/Gcode_Toolpath.md`, `settled.md` S1.7/S1.8/S1.10/S1.11 |
| Toolpath execution / playback | done | Precomputed continuous IK path (chunked, pause/resume) driven by Run/Pause/Reset + speed slider; the printed shape grows as the arm traces it — see `settled.md` S1.9/S1.11, `tutorials/Stage5_README.md` §5.3 |
| Build-plate position/orientation | done | Re-posable via Move/Reset/Save/Load Position buttons — see `wiki/003_Guides/BuildPlate_UserFrame.md`, `settled.md` S1.6 |

## Architecture Model

Model-View split: `geometry_backend.py` (VisContent) owns geometry state
and math; `gui_panel.py` (UI_Menu) owns ImGui widgets and calls into the
backend; `main.py` wires them together and drives Polyscope's per-frame
callback. See `wiki/002_Architecture/INDEX.md` as subsystems get built out.

## Key Constraints

- Mesh vertices are baked in zero-pose world coordinates — always apply the
  Delta transform (`GLOSSARY.md` §2), never `T_0_i(q)` directly.
- Requires a physical GPU with OpenGL >= 3.3 — won't run over Remote
  Desktop or in most VMs.

## Recent Decisions
