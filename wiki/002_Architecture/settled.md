# Settled Decisions

Architectural constraints that have been decided and should not be
re-discussed unless the listed condition changes. See
[`wiki-template/WIKI_CONSTRUCTION_GUIDE.md`](../../wiki-template/WIKI_CONSTRUCTION_GUIDE.md)
§3.2 for the format to use when adding entries:

**Non-revertible unless:** ...

## S1.1 Geometry logic lives on VisContent, not as bare module functions

**Decision:** `compute_fk`, `end_effector_position`, `load_mesh`, and
`load_data` are `VisContent` instance methods (`self.compute_fk(...)`,
etc.), not module-level functions. `dh_transform` stays a module-level
pure helper (stateless, no dependency on instance state). `MESH_DIR` and
`MESH_FILES` stay module-level constants (static path config, not instance
state).

**Reason:** `load_data` is about to start populating `self.mesh_data`
(currently an unused slot set in `__init__`), and `update_transformation`
already reads/writes `self.transformation` — consolidating all stateful
geometry operations behind the one object `gui_panel.py` already holds a
reference to avoids mixing bare module functions with class methods for
what is fundamentally the same backend responsibility. See the archived
previous layout at
[`_historical/2026-07-07_end_effector_position_reorg.md`](../005_AgentMgmt/_historical/2026-07-07_end_effector_position_reorg.md).

**Non-revertible unless:** the backend is split into multiple objects
(not currently planned).

**Verified on:** 2026-07-07
